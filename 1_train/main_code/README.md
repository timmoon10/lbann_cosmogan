## How to run the code:
1. First run the code ``pre_scale.py`` to apply normalization to the raw samples.
2. Give the normalized data as input to the code ``train_exagan.py``
3. Once the run completes and results are obtained, run code in the folder 2_create_images to read in a saved model and create more images.
